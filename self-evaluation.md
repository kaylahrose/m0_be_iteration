# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
###### I feel 11/19 confident

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0,
 and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge
 or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have
 productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
###### That felt uncomfortable and I definitely had an unproductive struggle in
###### the beginning, but I got some space, did something else, and I eventually
###### got the concept.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
###### I need to review all the concepts we learned in mod 0 to increase my comfortability
###### with them. I'll be adjusting my whole calendar to do this. Especially since I'll be going on vacation
###### next week.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
###### I don't have any questions at the moment.
